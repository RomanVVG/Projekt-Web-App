			<figcaption>Jerry Alan West[b] (May 28, 1938 – June 12, 2024) was an American basketball player and executive. 
				He played professionally for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA), and is widely regarded as one of the
				 greatest players of all time. His nicknames included "the Logo", in reference to his silhouette being the basis for the NBA logo; 
				 "Mr. Clutch", for his ability to make a big play in a key situation such as his famous buzzer-beating 60-foot shot that tied Game 3 of the
				  1970 NBA Finals against the New York Knicks; "Mr. Outside", in reference to his perimeter play with the Lakers and "Zeke from Cabin Creek" 
				  for the creek near his birthplace of Chelyan, West Virginia.

		<p>The National Basketball Association, or NBA, is a professional basketball league comprised of 30 teams across North America featuring the best basketball players in the world.</p>
		<p>The NBA is a collection of 30 teams, broken down by two conferences with three divisions apiece. 
			The Western Conference plays host to the Northwest, Pacific and Southwest Divisions, featuring the following 15 teams:</p>
		<p>&bull; Northwest: Denver Nuggets, Minnesota Timberwolves, Oklahoma City Thunder, Portland Trail Blazers, Utah Jazz</p>
		<p>&bull; Pacific: Golden State Warriors, L.A. Clippers, Los Angeles Lakers, Phoenix Suns, Sacramento Kings</p>
		<p>&bull; Southwest: Dallas Mavericks, Houston Rockets, Memphis Grizzlies, New Orleans Pelicans, San Antonio Spurs</p> 
		<p>The Eastern Conference’s 15 squads also break up across three divisions: the Atlantic, Southeast and Central:</p>
		<p>&bull; Atlantic: Boston Celtics, Brooklyn Nets, New York Knicks, Philadelphia 76ers, Toronto Raptors</p>
		<p>&bull; Central: Chicago Bulls, Cleveland Cavaliers, Detroit Pistons, Indiana Pacers, Milwaukee Bucks</p>
		<p>&bull; Southeast: Atlanta Hawks, Charlotte Hornets, Miami Heat, Orlando Magic, Washington Wizards</p> 
		<p>The NBA was created on August 3, 1949, with the merger of the Basketball Association of America (BAA) and the National Basketball League (NBL).
			 The league later adopted the BAA's history and considers its founding on June 6, 1946, as its own.</p>
		<p>The top eight teams in each Conference reach the postseason, with the No. 1 seed facing No. 8 in the first round, No. 2 vs. No. 7 and so on. Each round features a best-of-seven series with a 2-2-1-1-1 format (two games at the top seed’s home court, two games at the lower seed’s home, then back and forth one game at a time).</p>
		<P>NBA games are available on television in more than 200 countries around the world, including hundreds of national broadcasts in the USA every year on ABC, ESPN, TNT and NBA TV. Fans can also watch games live and on-demand on NBA LEAGUE PASS around the world.</P>	 
		<p>Each NBA team can have a maximum of 15 players, 12 of which can be active each game.</p>
		<p>Each quarter lasts 12 minutes. Each overtime lasts 5 minutes.</p>
		<p>The shot clock is 24 seconds.</p>
		<p>The rims hang 10 feet from the floor, sitting on opposite ends of a court that’s 50 feet wide and 94 feet long. Both ends of the floor feature a free throw line, 15 feet from the rim, and a 3-point arc that runs from 23 feet, 9 inches from the basket at the top of the perimeter to 22 feet at the baselines. The corner 3-pointer has become one of the league’s most popular shots because of the difference. The basketball itself measures 9 inches in diameter, and must be inflated to between 8.5 and 9.5 pounds per square inch.</p>
